      <h4>Newbie Explanation:</h4>

      <br>
      <br>
      
      <p>NFT is a Non Fungible Token. Non Fungible Token is a unique address 
        which help us to map a Non Fungible Asset. So What is a Non Fungible Asset? 
        NFA can be your mobile or house or your domain name. NFA should be unique 
        and it should have value which is unique.Consider your Domain Name, 
        it is unique and there cannot be any copy of it.So its one of its kind.
        NFT is just a unique number without mapping it to NFA.</p>

      <h4>Pro Explanation:</h4>

      <br>
      <br>
      
      <p>Most discussions about non-fungible tokens begin by introducing the idea of 
        fungibility, which is defined as “able to replace or be replaced by another identical item”. 
        We think this overcomplicates things. To get a better sense of what might constitute a 
        non-fungible asset, just think about most of the stuff you own. The chair you’re sitting in, 
        your phone, your laptop, anything you could go and sell on eBay. All of these fall under 
        the category of non-fungible things.
        It turns out that fungible assets are actually the odd ones out. A currency is a classic 
        example of a fungible asset. Five dollars is always five dollars no matter the serial number 
        on the specific five-dollar bill, or whether its five dollars sitting in your bank account. 
        The ability to replace a five-dollar bill with another five-dollar bill (or five ones, for that matter) 
        is what makes currency fungible.
        Note that fungibility is relative; it really only applies when comparing multiple things. 
        Consider business class, economy class, and first-class flight tickets. Each ticket is roughly 
        fungible within its class, but you couldn’t fairly swap a first-class ticket for a business class 
        ticket. Even the chair you’re sitting in is roughly fungible with a chair of the same model, unless 
        you’ve developed a special attachment to your particular chair.
        Interestingly, fungibility can also be subjective. Back to the flight ticket example: a person that cares 
        about sitting in a window seat vs. an aisle seat might not consider two economy class tickets 
        interchangeable. Similarly, a rare penny might be worth 1 cent to me but worth much more to 
        a coin collector. We’ll see that some of these nuances become important when representing these 
        items on blockchains.
